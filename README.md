# GroebnerWalkCode

* Implementation of the Groebner Walk using [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/), used in part for my Master's Thesis on the Groebner Walk, written in 2020
* GroebnerWalk.lib implements the actual walk, while the tst.sing files run the walk using different parameters.
* This was implemented to determine and demonstrate the likely infeasibility of giving time/distance estimates when performing a Groebner Walk.
* My overall thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/JackRBz/Master-Thesis-GroebnerBases)
